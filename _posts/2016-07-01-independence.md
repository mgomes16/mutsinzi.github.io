Happy Indepence Day Rwanda.

Today Rwanda celebrates her independence, her philosophy of self-reliance. And on a day like this, it is important to remind ourselves what it is we really mean when we talk about independence. I have here selected three works by some great minds in the world of literature that portray the significance of independence.

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wretched_of_the_Earth"> -  The Wretched of the Earth by Franz Fanon</a>
<blockquote>The Wretched of the Earth (French: Les Damn√©s de la Terre) is a 1961 book by Frantz Fanon, in which Fanon provides a psychiatric and psychologic analysis of the dehumanising effects of colonization upon the individual, and the nation, and discusses the broader social, cultural, and political implications inherent to establishing a social movement for the decolonization of a person and of a people. - Wikipidea </blockquote>

HomeComing by Ngugi Wa Thiong'O
<blockquote>Essays on Essays on African and Caribbean Literature, Culture, and Politics</blockquote>


<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Things_Fall_Apart"> - Things Fall Apart by Chinua Achebe</a>
<blockquote>Things Fall Apart is a post-colonial novel written by Nigerian author Chinua Achebe in 1958. It is seen as the archetypal modern African novel in English, one of the first to receive global critical acclaim. - Wikipidea</blockquote>



Independence can mean a lot of things, and for a nation, it can mean the difference between prosperity and poverty, not just economic poverty but also a poverty of ideas.

Being self-reliant might seem as though it implies that there's no need for co-operation but it actually opens more doors for partnership because there is a mutual benefit to be gained by the two parties as opposed to one party gaining all the benefits when an country is not independent.

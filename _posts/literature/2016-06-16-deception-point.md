Deception Point is Dan Brown’s third book published in 2001, focusing on the mysteries surrounding a NASA discovery in the Arctic ice. An expert on oceans and an intelligence agent are sent to verify its authenticity just as its deception plunges characters into a rollercoaster of spy movie-like run for their life and reputation.


This novel was not my firs rodeo with Dan Brown. I started with the exciting ‘Inferno’ at the beginning of my senior, in search of distraction in the form of mystery and intellect in novels. Thanks to a friend, I found one. And then I proceeded on to ‘Angels and Demons’. My mistake here was I read his books in the wrong order. But boy did I love the formula Brown used. It was a kind of consistency that felt assuring and was acceptable because Brown found a way to throw a new shocking revelation at you.


By formula I mean Brown’s use of a big mystery given at the beginning, a male and female protagonist with amazing intellectual capabilities, which they utilize to solve codes, coming face to face with an unexpected traitor and their twisted motives. The consistency almost did bore me.


But Brown brought me straight back in because he individualized the characters; he used various settings, and always managed to throw in shocking turns and reveals. A lot of the novels are based on real life facts of religious and scientific history and references that governments deny, so if you love conspiracies, his books are one of the best.


My favourite quote that I can remember off the top of my head was “Circumstances raise impossible decisions” – (Won’t tell you by, because that spoils the mystery) I love it because it perfectly defines every big mystery in all Brown’s books. And it’s applicable to real life.


He excited me because he used conflicts and dilemmas between important characters pushing them to commit unexpected acts. There was also that fast pace as I read page after page, my mind simultaneously wondering about what shocking twist he’d throw, and trying to keep up with some of his convoluted sentences. Sentences which no typical layman like me would comprehend, yet continues indulgence for the sake of the mystery.


If you read this book now, you’d be amused by one character that reminds you of a particular presidential candidate today. Amused, because of how well it portrays the over-confidence, the aspect of being disliked by a majority of the world etc.


My favorite character had to be the female lead. Rachel. She had this shock factor when she spoke to experts of fields she’s not expected to know, but she also held herself strongly against traitors or disliked characters (Yep, there were more than one if you read the novel). I also appreciate the scientist Corky Marlinson, given a short pudgy description and a character of someone smart but would amuse you in his social interactions. This depends on your sense of humour, of course.


Without going into the book to avoid spoilers, this novel has its own entertainment value for its scientific thriller aspect, and having to keep up with all the twists and turns, and compelling characters. Also, conspiracy theories are fascinating if you’re a naturally curious person.

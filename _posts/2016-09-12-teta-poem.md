excerpt: A poem written by Teta Kellie Karenzi

<div class="poetry-wrapper">

<blockquote>Fooled by hopes trickery.<br>
Turned lust into love<br>
-quite literally.<br>
Can't stop on the tracks,<br>
I'll die by my own minds attacks.<br>
Lived before life would let me.<br>
Now I've got to fill a void so empty.<br>
I'll just wait on the next spark<br>
To light up my inner dark.<br>
He'll grow into a fire elsewhere,<br>
And I'll be done- I'll swear.<br>
Dreaded hope will arrive,<br>
And through it all I'll thrive.<br>
The pain, my heart will store.<br>
Restart, encore.<br>
</blockquote>

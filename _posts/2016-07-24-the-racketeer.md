One word for John Grisham’s legal thriller The Racketeer: transfixing.

A few pages into the book that I for so long judged by the cover, I had drawn a list of John Grisham’s twenty four other books but had no intention whatsoever to place this one down. The Racketeer is a work of fiction but its concrete storyline fools one into thinking that the author’s originality is entirely based on his career –being a lawyer himself. Well, it’s not that way.

The story revolves around the death of the federal judge Raymond Fawcett and the theft of his mysteriously earned fortune. The protagonist, an African American attorney and a former US marine, Malcolm Bannister in the book’s first chapter has now spent five years in prison for an alleged racketeering act. In order not to serve the remaining half of his term, Bannister claims to know more than they do and makes a deal with the FBI after so many failed attempts to find judge Fawcett’s skilled killer.

John Grisham brilliantly tackles death and justice along with other themes including family, romance and wealth among others. In doing so, he also goes about adept character development which leave us personally attached to the characters. His voice, coherence and fluidity remain unequivocal throughout the novel, enduring numerous plot twists which keep us hooked until the last page. Lastly, the change of scenery is unbeatable. From Virginia to Montego Bay, the reader is definitely in for a ride.

Would I therefore recommend this book? Absolutely! I recommend anyone and everyone because this book’s uniqueness should not only be shared with a certain audience but all.

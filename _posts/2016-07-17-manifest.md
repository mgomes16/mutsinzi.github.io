> Driving in a storm, how I fit see ahead<br/>
Weather forecast, a bit nippy I heard<br/>
Beggars can't choose, but be picky instead<br/>
9 to 5 blues, kick me Iâ€™m dead<br/>

Who is <a href="http://manifestmc.com/" target="_blank">M.anifest?</a> Listen to any of his songs and you'll probably arrive at the same conclusion I did. He's a word-playing, witty lyricist that is, like <a href="http://www.kigalicious.com/#!sogokuru/ao7ue" target="_blank">Sogokuru</a>, not afraid to feed from his African roots. His music does exactly what music should do: represent the status quo. Born in Accra, Ghana, M.anifest whose real name is Kwame Tsikata, grandson of 93 year old Prof. J.H Nketia, one of the leading ethnomusicologists and composers in Africa, is definitely an African talent to follow, support and be proud of.

Rapping in English, Twi and Pidgin, M.anifest has a unique style that will have you nodding your head to his mind-picking, fresh lines. Unapologetically, he delivers fearless manifestations of his artistic mind in a manner that will have you wishing his songs would keep playing on and on and on.

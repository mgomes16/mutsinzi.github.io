> Hiphop is dead! They don't rap like they used to! Rap today is trash!

You hear such statements in various iterations many, many times and they seem to be saying pretty much the same thing except that what they imply is not the truth. Here's why:

There is indeed some truth in what these statements suggest, but the truth isn't that hiphop is dead, it is that hiphop has changed. But so has all forms of art, visual, written verse, prose et cetera. Change is of course inevitable, but that is a fact to be celebrated because without change, the human spirit would be stifled by immobility and a lack of progress. To continue saying that hiphop is no longer great is to lack the openness to embrace change, and it is failure to notice that what hiphop has done, is it has actually grown. More diverse, more inclusive and more expressive. If anything hiphop is very much alive now than it ever has been.

Hiphop is no longer just another track you hear on the radio of fresh MCs spitting bars, it has become a global culture. Go to any part of the world and I can guarantee you, the majority of the youth identify most with hiphop culture than with other cultures. There are many reasons as to why this is the case, but the strongest of all is that hiphop is a metaphor for freedom, the very action-demanding nature of the word is a symbol for expression, of a collapse of barriers, be it emotional or spiritual. 'Hip-Hop'!

So instead of continuing to criticize hiphop for what it is now(yes, I'all go ahead and admit that the state of hiphop is a little shaky at the moment), let us support those that properly represent it, those that continue to grow and express themselves through this far-reaching art form. And while we're at it, let's give Sogokuru's first official mixtape <a href="http://www.kigalicious.com/#!sogokuru/ao7ue" title="Stream Kanura on Kigalicious" target="_blank">'Kanura'</a> a listen over at <a href="http://www.kigalicious.com/#!sogokuru/ao7ue" title="Stream Kanura on Kigalicious" target="_blank">Kigalicious</a>
